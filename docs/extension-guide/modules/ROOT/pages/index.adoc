:navtitle: JobRunr Pro Extension
= JobRunr Pro

The purpose of this extension is to leverage some features only available in the Pro version of link:https://www.jobrunr.io/en/documentation/pro/[JobRunr,window=_blank,role=external]. Only the Pro version allows to search existing jobs by status and label. This is required for the deadline manager to implement the `cancelAll` methods. The xref:axon-framework-references:deadlines:deadline-managers.adoc[deadline managers] section has more in depth information on deadline managers. Although jobs created with the non-pro `DeadlineManager` will be eligible to be canceled, this is only true when they were created with the `4.8` or later versions. Jobs created with the `4.7.x` version are missing the correct labels and will not be found when trying to cancel them.


== Spring usage

For Spring usage, be sure to include the starters, both of JobRunr Pro and the extension. The deadline manager should be available by using parameter-based injection. It can be used in aggregates and sagas using something like:

[tabs]
======
Aggregate::
+
[source,java]
----
@CommandHandler
public void handle(SomeCommand command, @Autowired DeadlineManager deadlineManager) { ... }
----

Saga::
+
--
[source,java]
----
@StartSaga
public void handle(SomeEvent event, @Autowired DeadlineManager deadlineManager) { ... }
----

Alternatively, you could also auto wire the deadline manager to the class like:
[source, java]
----
@Autowired
void setDeadlineManager(DeadlineManager deadlineManager) {
    this.deadlineManager = deadlineManager;
}
----
======

== Non Spring usage
An JobRunrProDeadlineManager instance can be created using the builder like this:

[source,java]
----
JobRunrProDeadlineManager.proBuilder()
        .jobScheduler(jobScheduler)
        .storageProvider(storageProvider)
        .scopeAwareProvider(scopeAwareProvider)
        .serializer(serializer)
        .transactionManager(transactionManager)
        .spanFactory(spanFactory)
        .build();
----
You probably want to use some form of dependency injection instead of creating a new deadline manager each time you need one.
